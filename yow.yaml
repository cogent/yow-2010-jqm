        You will learn about the changes in Rails 3 that make
        your life as a web developer easier. Most of the significant changes have to do
        with the implementation of Rails under the covers. We'll look at what those
        changes are and how they affect you. We'll also take a look at which APIs
        changed, from initialization hooks to query generation with Arel, a relational
        algebra library. Other topics include the new ActiveModel library, the
        influence of Merb on Rails 3, its overall Modularity and Bundler.

        Asynchronous, event-driven &quot;reactive&quot; programming is way too hard in 
        today's world of development tools and frameworks. The huge amount of 
        manual and error-prone plumbing leads to incomprehensible and hard to 
        maintain code. As we reach out to services in the cloud, the desire for 
        asynchronous computation is ever increasing, requiring a fresh look on 
        the problems imposed by reactive programming. Centered around the 
        concept of observable data sources, Rx provides a framework that takes 
        care of the hard parts of reactive programming. Instead of focusing on 
        the hard parts, you now can start dreaming about the endless 
        possibilities of composing queries over asynchronous data sources, 
        piggybacking on convenient LINQ syntax. In this session, we'll cover the
        design philosophy of Rx, rooted on the deep duality between the 
        interactive IEnumerable interface and the new reactive IObservable 
        interface in .NET 4. From this core understanding, we'll start looking 
        at various combinators and operators defined over observable 
        collections, as provided by Rx, driving concepts home by a bunch of 
        samples. Finally, if time permits, we'll look at the Reactive Extensions
        for JavaScript which allows us to take the concepts we already know 
        from Rx and apply them to JavaScript and have deep integration with 
        libraries such as jQuery.&nbsp; Democratizing asynchronous programming starts
        today. Don't miss out on it!

        Calling everything a service 
        makes the term meaningless. Now, we've got 13 different kinds of 
        services and no clue when to use which one. Is a single operation a

        functions like authorization and data access? If you've been wondering

        The Fortress programming language integrates traditional mathematical
        notation into an object-oriented framework based on traits with
        multiple inheritance, overloading (of both methods and functions)
        resolved by symmetric dynamic dispatch, static types, and separately
        compiled modules.  A component/API system governs visibility of traits,
        objects, and functions, but it is desirable to regard overloadings that
        are visible to the callee as part of its implementation, even though
        they may not be visible to the caller.  This complicates the rules for dispatch.
        Simply put, the same method name may refer to different methods
        in different compilation units, depending on the import and export declarations,
        and the implementation has to make it all work.
        </p>
        <p>
        Moreover, a longstanding problem with multiple inheritance is what to do when
        methods inherited from several parents conflict.  Many approaches have
        been explored in the literature; some unfortunately violate the
        intuitively desirable requirement that the function or method invoked
        be the uniquely most specific one that is both accessible and
        applicable.  Fortress detects potential overloading ambiguity at compile time
        and issues error messages explaining to the programmer what additional
        overloadings are needed to resolve the problem; therefore it is impossible for any
        function or method call to be ambiguous.  This idea goes back nearly
        two decades, but Fortress appears to be the first programming language
        to adopt the idea and enforce it statically, even in the face of separate compilation.
        It enables a distributed implementation of dispatching that is easy to explain
        and allows selective export and selective optimization.  In this way a single
        strategy meets the requirements of both the multimethod dispatch and the
        component visibility rules.

        Google App Engine is a framework that lets you build web apps on top of Google's scalable hosting and data storage infrastructure. When you start building an app on App Engine, you soon realize that you do things differently from the way you made apps for more &quot;traditional&quot; hosting setups, because of our scalability-oriented design. In this talk, we'll give an overview of App Engine, and then look at how you would handle things like offline processing, geographic queries, or storing files, and how you would design real world apps like a microblogging service or social network site.

        With the advent of new, fast virtual machines and frameworks for both in- and out-of-browser usage, Javascript has stepped into its rightful place as a productive, object-oriented language. More and more, we see full-featured applications being built entirely in this great language. Unfortunately, a lot of the coding habits remain from its humble origin as 'just an html scripting language.' Automated testing is accepted as standard in most other languages, why not in Javascript? 
        </p>
        <p>
        In this talk, we'll look at techniques and tools for testing your Javascript effectively. Just getting the tools set up can be daunting, so we'll spend some time looking at setup. Testing interactions with your HTML can be tricky, so we'll cover tips for effectively interacting with your web pages in your tests.

        The misnamed &quot;NoSQL&quot; movement is less of a rejection of the relational technology that has served us well for 40 years, but rather an embrace of persistence technologies that help us solve problems not well addressed by the classic RDBMS. This talk will provide an overview of the &quot;NoSQL&quot; landscape and in addition, describe both the technology behind and a significant deployment example of Neo4J, a graph-oriented alternative data store.

        As software development leaders, we need to think more strategically. Some design decisions affect the trajectory of the whole project or even the organization. These decisions arise in early chartering and throughout development, and they are about much more than architecture. This talk will examine these issues through the lens of the Strategic Design principles of domain-driven design (DDD), which systematize a few critical practices some successful teams do intuitively. <br />
        <br />
        It is common for skilled teams to deliver software they are not proud of, due to compromises with legacy designs. Others toil for years, producing a platform that is never used to good advantage. These are strategic failures. On the other hand, there are projects with a direct explanation of how the software contributes to business goals. There are projects where designers work with a realistic view of the context of their development within the larger system, allowing them to maintain design clarity and integrity. These are strategic successes. Winning strategy starts with the domain. <br />
        <br />
        Two DDD principles, &quot;Context Mapping&quot; and &quot;Distilling the Core Domain&quot;, help you see your strategic situation more clearly and approach strategic design decisions more systematically. These techniques require extensive interaction with domain experts as well as the leaders of the organization, in discussions broader than functional requirements. They sometimes lead to priorities quite different from our most comfortable notions. <br />

        People have been talking about &quot;scaling&quot; and &quot;distributed systems&quot; a 
        great deal lately.  We need to clarify the meaning of these terms in 
        order to have a worthwhile conversation about them.  We will do so by 
        discussing the details of how to actually produce practical, scalable, 
        distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        That discussion will focus on methods for designing and building 
        robust fundamentally-concurrent distributed systems.  These approaches 
        have been learned through building user-facing web applications, data 
        storage and processing systems, and server management tools.  We will 
        look at practices that are &quot;common knowledge&quot; but too often forgotten, 
        at lessons that the software industry at large has somehow missed, and 
        at general &quot;good practices&quot; and rules that must be thrown away when 
        moving into a distributed and concurrent world.

        Google is known to operate one of the largest civilian computing infrastructures. These hardware resources are managed by a vast collection of software frameworks and tools, which form the basis for highly parallelized, reliable, low-latency, high-throughput applications. They also provide useful programming abstractions that speed up development and debugging. Some parts of this infrastructure, such as MapReduce, GFS, Sawzall, Chubby, Protocol Buffers, are available as open source projects or published in academic papers, while others are proprietary. Rather than dive into the dark corners of each of these tools, this talk tries to distill key design themes 
        and patterns, which enable these unique capabilities, and can be re-used in other contexts.

        In this tutorial, you will learn how to create applications that survive the rigors of life in production. Too often, project teams aim to pass QA instead of aiming&nbsp;for success in production. Testing is not enough to prove that your software is ready for continuous availability in the corrosive environment of the Internet. 
        </p>
        <p>
        During this tutorial, you will receive an understanding of the architecture and design patterns that can produce high availability in distributed, multithreaded&nbsp;systems such as those based on Java EE, .Net, or Ruby on Rails. You will also learn about the antipatterns that can sabotage your systems availability and&nbsp;capacity. <b></b>

        Erlang is a programming language which has been picking up steam the last few years, in particular in domains that require a lot of coordination in the application logic.  The language supports a simple and consistent set of features for writing concurrent distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        Over the last few years, I have been meeting &quot;Erlang people&quot; more and more often, and I have been getting the impression that they have a magical ability to reason intuitively about concurrent systems in a way that I have not. It corresponds somewhat to the way we &quot;object heads&quot; think intuitively about classes and objects - just in terms of processes. That bothered me, so I wanted to learn Erlang.
        </p>
        <p>
        Being a language implementor, the most obvious way to do that is to just go ahead and implement an Erlang VM, right?  The result of this &quot;little exercise&quot; is Erjang, an open-source JVM-based Erlang VM. It has turned into a non-trivial project, Erjang is now +50k lines of Java code, and it runs substantial erlang programs.
        </p>
        <p>
        This adventure to Erlang-land have taught me many things about how &quot;Erlang people&quot; think.  I am beginning to understand how they think in processes/actors, how they model things and how they handle the complexity that arises in concurrent systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the first part of my talk, I'll go through some of these lessons, some of the aha!'s and the insights into Erlang's secret sauce, and present some of the patterns Erlang'ers use to describe and model systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        Secondly, I'll take you through some of the highlights of the Erjang VM; which is just another angle at describing how Erlang and Java differs.

        Languages - what's to learn from them? Relics of the past; we know how to design them / to use them. Types / messages / invocation / loops / numbers / methods / big ol' libraries / lots of = signs. Heh, but what is programming, and what role do programming languages play in that process? We have learned a lot over the last five decades: organizing principles, established conventions, theory, fashions, and fads. &quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot; In this talk we survey what we think are the most important lessons of the past that future programmers, and future programming language designers, ought not forget. We illustrate each lesson by discussing specific programming languages of the past, and endeavor to shine what light we can on the future.

        REST is ready for the enterprise. Imagine an information platform that is open and available to systems throughout the enterprise estate. A platform that eschews integration in favour of composition, connected data over siloed databases. A networked data structure with the power to implement valuable business behaviours: a distributed, hypermedia-driven application platform.
        Using techniques drawn from the forthcoming O'Reilly book 'REST in Practice', in this session I show how to model business processes as domain application protocols, implement them in terms of resource lifecycles, and execute them using HTTP idioms, media types and link relation values.

        Continuous Integration is great but what happens when your builds get out of control? What happens when you have too many build plans, that

        This session describes the current thinking about <i>emergent</i> design, discovering design in code. The hazard of Big Design Up Front in software is that you don't yet know what you don't know, and design decisions made too early are just speculations without facts. Emergent design techniques allow you to wait until the last responsible moment to make design decisions. This talk covers four areas: emergent design enablers, battling things that make emergent design hard, finding 
        idiomatic patterns, and how to leverage the patterns you find. It includes both proactive (test-driven development) and reactive (refactoring, metrics, visualizations, tests) approaches to discovering design, and discusses the use of custom attributes, DSLs, and other techniques for utilizing them. The goal of this talk is to provide nomenclature, strategies, and techniques for allowing <i>design</i> to emerge from projects as they proceed, keeping your code in sync with the problem domain.

        There's nothing like a crisis to remove artificial barriers. In thissession, Michael will present an experience report about development and operations coming together after a failed launch. Aside from the funof sharing war stories and comparing scars, what can we learn about climbing out of a crater after the worst has already happened? Can we capture the special magic of a firefighting mission during more sedate times? Beyond all of that, come find out how to stay out of the crater to begin with.

        The Web has never been more open to everyone. Open Data services exist in almost every web application: from social networking apps to governmental pages and the news, all this data can be instantly accessed by exposed APIs. However, although most of this data is offered in a simple interchange format, its structures are quite complex, ranging from complex networks to time-based information, hierarchical data or heavy graphs. Displaying this data in a manner that enables the viewer to gain some insight can be challenging, especially if we aim at providing some interaction and doing it in a cross-browser/cross-device manner. The JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit creates interactive data visualizations for the Web. It's based solely on Web Standards, leveraging the power of native browser technologies to provide insights on complex data. In this talk you will learn about the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit and how it can help you create advanced data visualizations for the Web.

        Henry Ford changed the world through the manufacturing machinery he created over 100 years ago. Separating 'thinking' from 'doing', Mr Ford defined a management archetype for large western organisations that still persists over a century later. But as we move to an information age at break-neck speed, does command &amp; control management still look as compelling?<br />

        In this presentation, Richard will discuss the history of management science and how management techniques affect the performance of technology teams and IT divisions.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will demonstrate the fundamental differences between today's two prevalent management theories: Scientific Management Theory and Systems Management Theory. He will explore the&nbsp;foundations of management theory in philosophical thought, the development of management models through political and military leadership, and ultimately the application of management concepts in today's information age. Richard will investigate a number of case studies from IT and beyond, presenting empirical evidence that demonstrates a change in management philosophy can directly affect business results. This presentation is a must for anyone interested in or involved in enterprise level Agile adoption or simply with an interest in hearing more on 'Lean &amp; Systems Thinking' from an experienced practitioner.

        Conventional wisdom says that memory is fast, disk is slow, networks are slower and that fast systems must be highly concurrent to achieve maximum performance. Much of this is outdated and some of it is now wrong. Modern hardware is phenomenally fast, but we have become complacent and use it in extremely inefficient and inappropriate ways. 
        </p>
        <p>
        For world class performance on commodity hardware you need to take a holistic approach to software design. The good news is that all the stuff we learned in computer science 101 is what really matters, choose your data structures carefully, model your domain, understand your platform, work hard to have a clear separation of concerns, but as well as all of that, run your business logic on a single thread!?

        The ability to collect and store data continues to increase, but our ability to understand it remains unchanged. Data visualization makes use of our evolutionary proclivity for decoding visual images and employs this ability as a high-bandwidth means of getting data into our heads. In this talk, I'll present work I've developed ranging from illustrations of data for magazines and journals to software tools used by geneticists to interactive applications for Fortune 10 companies.

        We are building the same types of systems as we built yesterday,
        the demands placed on our systems becomes more and more demanding. We
        need to handle more users, offer more intelligent behavior, provide
        different behavior for differenet clients, parallelize both development
        and deployment, handle partial failures in our applications, offer the
        operations team rich insight into our systems and the ability to tweak
        them at runtime and so much more.

        <p>
        Trying to build such application using the standard
        N-tiered architecture has proven to be hard, challenging and complex.
        In this session, you will learn how changing some of the underlying
        architectural concepts in how we build applications can lead to simpler
        solutions that scale extremely well. Those concepts include divide and
        conquer, background evaluation, one way messaging and ruthless
        application of the single responsibility principle. We will cover the
        full gamot, from building dynamic data models to customizing behaviors

        Pull means a lot of things to a lot of people: 
        </p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Pull = Pursuing Passion </li>
        	<li>Pull = Putting Customers First </li>
        	<li>Pull = Producing Based on Demand </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        These definitions of pull have something in common; they all contain a strong element of observation, orientation, decision, and action &ndash; the OODA loop. As the pace of business increases and unexpected events become common, pull becomes like an increasingly attractive alternative to push. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The problem is, pull doesn't work without preparation. Pull requires an environment that sends the correct signals, methods to rapidly detect the right patterns, and people who have the skills and training to make the right decisions. So the real challenge of pull is creating the environment, devising the patterns, and developing the people that ensure the right decisions are made and rapidly carried out, no matter what situation presents itself.

        Building scalable, highly-available applications that perform well is not an easy task. These features cannot be simply &ldquo;bolted&rdquo; onto an existing application &ndash; they have to be 
        architected into it. Unfortunately, the things we need to do to achieve them are often in conflict with each other, and finding the right balance is crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this session we will discuss why scaling web applications is difficult and will look at some of solutions we have come up with in the past to deal with the issues involved. We will then look 
        at how in-memory data grids can make our jobs easier by providing a solid architectural foundation to build our applications on top of.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are new to in-memory data grids, you are guaranteed to leave the presentation eager to learn more. However, even if you are already using one you will likely walk out with a few ideas on 
        how to improve performance and scalability of your applications.

      Rod is SVP, Middleware and GM of the SpringSource division at VMware. He is a thought leader on open source, as well as a popular speaker at conferences and symposia around the world. Spring was based on the code published with Rod's best-selling Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development (2002). This book was one of the most influential books ever published on J2EE and the sequel, J2EE without EJB (July 2004, with Juergen Hoeller), has proven almost equally significant, establishing a comprehensive vision for lightweight, post-EJB J2EE development.
      </p>
      <p>
      Rod has specialized in server-side Java since 1996 across a wide range of industries. His hands-on experience has led him to see problems from a client's perspective as well as a technology perspective, and has driven his influential criticism of bloated, inefficient, orthodox approaches to J2EE architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
      Rod is a member of the Java Community Process (JCP) Executive Committee (EC). EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies by approving and voting on all technology proposals. They are also responsible for defining the JCP's rules of governance and the legal agreement between members and the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
      Rod holds a BA with Honors in Computer Science, Mathematics and Musicology as well as a Phd from the University of Sydney.

      <p>
      Michael strives to raise the bar and ease the pain for developers across the country. He shares his passion and energy for improvement with everyone he meets, sometimes even with their permission. Michael has spent the better part of 20 years learning what it means to be a professional programmer who cares about art, quality, and craft.  He's always ready to spend time with other developers who are fully engaged and devoted to their work--the &quot;wide awake&quot; developers.  On the flip side, he cannot abide apathy or wasted potential.
      </p>
      <p>
      Michael has been a professional programmer and architect for nearly 20 years.  During that time, he has delivered running systems to the U. S. Government, the military, banking, finance, agriculture, and retail industries. More often than not, Michael has lived with the systems he built.  This experience with the real world of operations changed his views about software architecture and development forever.
      </p>
      <p>
      He worked through the birth and infancy of a Tier 1 retail site and has often served as &quot;roving troubleshooter&quot; for other online businesses.  These experiences give him a unique perspective on building software for high performance and high reliability in the face of an actively hostile environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      Most recently, Michael wrote &quot;Release It! Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software&quot;, a book that realizes many of his thoughts about building software that does more than just pass QA, it survives the real world.  Michael previously wrote numerous articles and editorials, spoke at Comdex, and co-authored one of the early Java books.

      Corey Haines has spent much of his 13+year professional
      career in the Microsoft ecosystem, until moving out of the corporate world and
      joining a small startup doing Ruby on Rails. After leaving the startup in 2008,
      he began a year-long journey, traveling the midwest and east coast of the
      United States on a pair-programming tour. He would spend anywhere from a day to
      a week at different places, pairing with people in exchange for room and board.
      While on the road, he has also focused on expanding and defining the message of
      the Software Craftsmanship movement, as it pertains to both professionalism and
      career development.
      </p>
      <p>
      Corey has been practicing the Extreme Programming techniques for nearly 6
      years; following the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) techniques since the
      first rumblings of it in 2005. Lately, he has been actively mentoring others in
      the BDD workflow, as it pertains to day-to-day engineering practices, such as
      test-driven design, executable acceptance criteria and 'outside-in'
      development.
      </p>
      <p>
      Nowadays, Corey travels to speak, study and facilitate <a href="http://www.coderetreat.com/" title="Code Retreat">Code Retreat</a> events.
      During his travels, he is also collecting ideas for establishing a
      craftsmanship-based school of software development.

      <p>
      Dan Ingalls is the principal
      architect of five generations of Smalltalk environments. He designed the
      byte-coded virtual machine that made Smalltalk practical in 1976. He later
      conceived a Smalltalk written in itself and made portable and efficient by a
      Smalltalk-to-C translator, now known as the Squeak open-source Smalltalk. Dan
      also invented BitBlt, the general-purpose graphical operation that underlies
      most bitmap graphics systems today, as well as pop-up menus. His most recent
      work, the Lively Kernel, is a dynamic graphics and programming environment that
      runs entirely in a browser. Able to save its results and even new versions of
      itself as web pages, if offers the promise that wherever there is the web there
      is authoring. Dan received his B.A. in Physics from <st1:place><st1:placename>Harvard</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from <st1:place><st1:placename>Stanford</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>. He is a recipient of the ACM Grace Hopper Award, and
      the ACM Software Systems Award.<br />

      <p>
      Dave Farley has been having fun with computers for nearly 30 years.
      Over that period he has worked on most types of software, from
      firmware, through tinkering with operating systems and device drivers,
      to writing games, and commercial applications of all shapes and sizes.
      He started working in large scale distributed systems about 20 years
      ago, doing research into the development of loose-coupled,
      message-based systems - a forerunner of SOA. He has a wide range of
      experience leading the development of complex software in teams, both
      large and small, in the UK and USA. Dave was an early adopter of agile
      development techniques, employing iterative development, continuous
      integration and significant levels of automated testing on commercial
      projects from the early 1990s. He honed his approach to agile
      development in his four and a half year stint at ThoughtWorks where he
      was a technical principal working on some of their biggest and most
      challenging projects. Dave is currently working for the London
      Multi-Asset Exchange (LMAX), an organization that is building one of
      the highest performance financial exchanges in the world.

      Head of Audiological Software Development for Cochlear, whom he has been with for 10 years. Victor Rodrigues has over 18 years' experience in the IT sector. Previously working in fields as diverse as
      manufacturing control systems, service station and postal management systems and medical devices, Victor introduced Scrum to the Cochlear software team four years ago, with positive results. Since then engineering teams throughout the organisation are using Agile practices and methods.

      One of the keys to the success of the software his teams deliver are Agile practices and methods. Utilising the closer relationships with stakeholders that form using this process, the teams
      have been able to provide stakeholders the opportunity to shape the product during its development. This is complemented by the team's use and Victor's passion for user-centred interaction design.

      After some unsuccessful attempts at demo programming in the 80s, Emil Eifrem

      of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
      100 000 lines of spaghetti C, almost as many segfaults and 
      several sleepless years later, he escaped into the warm embrace of Java 1.0a2 
      and has stayed there ever since. (He has no regrets but is secretly proud that 
      the text game he founded is still played almost 15 years later.)
      </p>
      <p>
      After a decade as a developer, mentor and architect at a consulting- and product company in southern Sweden, Emil's current focus is on evangelizing graph databases and preaching the demise of tabular solutions everywhere.

      <p>
      Ulf Wiger became one of the first commercial users of Erlang (certainly the first in North America) when he bought a license in 1993. At the time, he was busy designing disaster response systems in Alaska. In 1996, he joined Ericsson and became Chief Designer of the AXD 301 development. At nearly 2 million lines of Erlang code, AXD 301 is the most complex system ever built in Erlang, and probably the most complex commercial system built in any functional language. In recent years, Ulf has been involved in several products based on the AXD 301<br />
      architecture, and has been an active member of the Open Source Erlang community. In February 2009, Ulf began his new job as CTO of Erlang Solutions Ltd.

Previous experience includes architecture and design of decision support technology for the US DOD and the
      Alaska Integrated Incident Management System.. A special interest is trying to bridge the cultures of research, Open Source development, and industrial
      design.
