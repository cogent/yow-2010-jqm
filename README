It's a yow app!

There's two pieces:

1. A plain-ruby screen-scraper that takes the raw YOW schedule and turns it into something more structured.
2. A pith website that presents a jquery mobile based frontend to that data

To make it go:

ruby parse.rb # this generates a yow.json and yow.yaml file
rake serve
